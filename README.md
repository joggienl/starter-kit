# General info

This starter-kit project is a fork from the original starter-kit by the Ember.js
team. See their [github page](https://github.com/emberjs/starter-kit) for the
original repository.

The original starter-kit was forked to use it as an 'Site Template' whitin
your Netbeans HTML5 projects (available from version 7.3 and ongoing!). I missed
some compliancy with JSHint so the main app.js file has been changed a little.
